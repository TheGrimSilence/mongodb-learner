# MongoDB Learner

This is a super simple application because I'm learning MongoDB from [this article](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/) by Zell.

# Build it

Just run `yarn build`. That'll store the project in `dist` and generate a `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` in the root directory.

# Start it

Running `yarn start` will create a `nodemon` instance, and http://localhost:3000 will be the application server. mongodb://localhost:27017/ will be the database server, `star-wars-quotes` and `testyDB` are your two collections available. I'd recommend using MongoDB Compass if you don't have a GUI for MongoDB.
